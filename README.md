# Part Presence Checker (YOLO + Streamlit)

A Streamlit-based web application that checks for the presence of specific car parts in uploaded video files using YOLO object detection.

---

## Demo

Upload a video and automatically:
- Extract frames every N seconds
- Run YOLOv8 object detection
- Check if required car parts are present
- Display and download annotated frames + detection report

---

## Model Support

This app works with both:

- ✅ **Pretrained YOLO models** (e.g., `yolov8n.pt`)
- ✅ **Custom-trained YOLO models** (like your own)

Simply change the path in the code:
```python
model = YOLO("your_model.pt")
````

This repo was built using a **custom YOLO model** trained to detect specific car parts.

---

## 🏷Supported Labels (Custom Model)

The following labels are supported by the custom model used in this project:

* `arm rest`
* `clip door trim`
* `door trim`
* `front assist grip`
* `inner brush`
* `inner handle`
* `outer mirror inner cover`
* `screw inner handle`
* `weather strip door`

---

## 🎯 Detection Target

You can define which parts are **required for presence checking**.

By default, the app is configured to detect:

```python
TARGET_CLASSES = {"weather strip door"}
```

This is easily modifiable in the code to check for multiple or different parts based on your use case.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/part-presence-checker.git
cd part-presence-checker
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 📦 Output

* Annotated image frames saved every 3 seconds
* CSV report with detection results
* ZIP of all processed frames

---

## 📥 Model Weights

Place your YOLO model (e.g., `yolo-world.pt`) in the project root, or update the model path in the code.

To test with a standard model:

```bash
from ultralytics import YOLO
YOLO('yolov8n.pt').export()
```
